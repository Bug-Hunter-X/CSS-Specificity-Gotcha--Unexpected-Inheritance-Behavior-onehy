The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container div p {
  color: purple; /* This is where the unexpected behavior occurs */
}
```

The expected behavior might be that the `<p>` element inside the `.container div` inherits the `color: red` from its parent.  However, due to CSS specificity rules, the `color: purple` style on `.container div p` will override the inherited `color: red`. This is because the selector `.container div p` is more specific than the selector `.container div` (it includes an additional element, making it more precise).
