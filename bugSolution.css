To fix this, we can adjust the CSS to ensure the intended color inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container {
  color: red; /* Apply color to the container directly */
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container div p {
  color: purple; /* This style is still more specific, but the inheritance is managed differently */
}
```

By applying the `color: red;` to the `.container` itself, the `<div>` within the `.container` will properly inherit this color.  Alternatively, you could adjust selector order or even use `!important` (though generally discouraged) to handle these issues, but managing inheritance properly through the specificity of selectors is the preferred approach.
